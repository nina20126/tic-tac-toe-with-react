# tic tac toe with React
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

This project is made by following reactjs.org original tutorial and its purpose for me is mostly to getting familiar with React.
In this project I'm building an interactive tic-tac-toe game with React.
One of the features in the game is a numbered list to the right of the gameâ€™s board. This list gives a history of all of the moves that player have occurred in the game, and it is updated as the game progresses.


# What did I learn?
This tutorial teached me:
- fundamentals of React: components, props and state
- most common techniques in React development
- how to record users game history

# Ideas to improve the game in future
- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
